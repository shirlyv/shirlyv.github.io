### Prolog

>"I want to be the sun for you."

I strum my guitar, singing a beautiful voice that echoes to my ears.  
From my lips, this golden voice continues to flow, singing a melodious heart song, its notes just flow through my head.

>“I want to always be the sun for you.”

I speak about what my heart's wants once more.  
The girl beside me smiled, in her eyes I saw a light shining.  
So thick, I could tell her was looking at me lovingly.  
For a split second, I was stunned by it.

This is my song, this is my voice for you.  
Even though the sun isn't always there, I still want to be something like that.  
Illuminate your steps and accompany your day.  
Even if tired is replaced by night, I want to still be the sun.
Shine to warm your heart from loneliness, 
then, replace your sadness with a light that the moon can't give.
Love me like the sky loves the sun, 
then I will love you like the way the sun loves the universe.

Think of me like a sunflower.
Or everything, something shine. 
It's a sunrise, beautiful, but even when you know that it's not forever...
At least, all that's left is, I'll always be looking at you.


### "How Pretty" - CHapter 1


A young man in a white and gray uniform was sitting alone.  
His hand lazily held a spoon and stirred the meatball sauce in his bowl.  
His lips were flat, not showing any emotion.  He looked around, the entire cafeteria was deserted, there were only a few people there.

>"Noah!"

Someone broke Noah's empty mind.  
His eyes shifted, immediately finding the source of the voice that calling him.  
He saw, the friend he had known since childhood was running panting to where that handsome young man was sitting.

>"There are parents of new students looking for you."

Rafka was silent for a while,  

>“I think it's really important.  He looks worried."

He grabbed his uniform coat that had been hanging at the cafeteria chair where he was sitting. 
He put it on immediately and hurriedly, a sense of responsibility filled his chest.

>"Thanks Ka!"  

He said, before going to where someone was waiting.
Noah stepped.  The feet were firm, the footsteps confident and confident.  
His charm, full of charisma.  His appearance was neat, that hair was too soft for the man's size was also neatly arranged.  
His skin was soft and white, no matter how often he was in the hot sun, he rarely turned tan. 
He is gorgeous.

>"Good afternoon, Sir.  I'm Noah, the person in charge of the new student orientation program."

Noah held out his hand to a four-headed man standing in front of him now.  
The man took Noah's hand.  They shook hands for a long time, Noah knew clearly that the man must be praising him secretly  
He had seen people fascinated by him for a long time.
There was nothing that Noah wanted to have anymore, he already had everything. 
A pair of beautiful eyes, a golden voice that no one in this school could match.  
Of course it wasn't Noah who crowned all of that, everyone already knew.  
He is the only child of Ringgo Mahendra, the owner of this school's foundation.  
Of course, Noah already has the money and all the facilities.  
He also has a lot of fans, new students always think of him as the ideal man.  
Noah is good at singing and cooking, who wouldn't want to be his girl. 
Unfortunately, he is always expressionless.  
No one knows what's in his heart or something in his minds.  
Except for those honey-brown eyes, there was always a feeling.  Dissatisfaction.

>"I'm Tom.  It turns out that the person in charge of this orientation event is a student too, 
right.”

The man had shaken off his hands to Noah.
Now his lips curved into a smile, Noah replied.  
As usual, Noah smiled meaninglessly. Looks handsome but has absolutely no implied meaning.  
Sometimes it looks like he's forced to smile.

>"I'm in third grade.  Please sit down, sir."

The man then sat in front of this super handsome young man.  
Now the air is frozen.  Meanwhile, there was a serious atmosphere that suddenly burst into the room where they met.

>“My daughter, her name is Melva. She told me, she was in the Festival room and was chosen to be the chief coordinator of the students,” the man opened the conversation.

Noah's eyes wandered, remembering the faces of the girl named Melva.  Unfortunately, he found nothing.

>“Yes, sir. In each room, one student was chosen to be the coordinator of the room and later could help us make reports on class conditions for each senior who served as the committee.  But you don't have to worry, it's only during orientation.  After school, all students are ensured to go home on time.”  

He explained, smile while showing a neat row of teeth.
The almost middle-aged man nodded.

>"Good.  I'm just a little worried, this is the first time my child is attending a public school. She is accustomed to homeschooling since childhood.  I'm afraid she's having a hard time to adapting."

Noah then nodded respectfully.  He wanted to ask why the girl that the man's described was homeschooled from a young age, but he thought the question was too personal to be discussed with strangers like him.

>"Dont worry.  I will pay attention to her and help her if she is in trouble."  

Noah said.
The man took Noah's hand, shaking it.

>“I trust you, young man.  Thank you for your help."

Noah smiled.  Then escorted the man to the school gate, watching him go.
He then immediately looked for Rafka, his best friend.

>“Do you know Melva Adiatama?  In which class she was?”

Rafka recalled his memories.

>"Oh, that lovely girl. She's at 10-2.  Why?  Have a crush? Lol"

Noah glared, 

>"Nonsense."

Rafka then continued his story, 

>“She is the most beautiful new student, and she's really smart and active.  She even ran for the chair of the coordinator, and was already elected.  This morning dhe was also the one who was appointed to be the leader of the new student admission ceremony on Friday."

Noah was stunned, he was a little surprised because Rafka was not that someone who would just praise others.

>"Really?"

Rafka rolled his eyes,

>"Aish, you don't believe it? Don't you? Come on, let's get to know her directly."

He suggested, quickly grabbing Noah's hand and leading him into a crowded classroom.
