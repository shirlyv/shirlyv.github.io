Dark disappears,<br>
I see the light.<br>
Grey turns into a shades of pink ; <br>
the sinister moon vanished in the shy sunshine ; <br>
Me , see another side of my world.<br>

I thought it was just torture and then life turned into hell,<br>
I thought i was just an ocean and then someday going to be a storm,<br>
but it wasn't; everything is just done. <br>

I shine under the shining sun,<br>
I look at my world again,<br>
Now with a wide view, i find it well there; <br>
-you and all my happiness<br>
-you are my space. <br>
-you are : the happiness.<br>

i never been there and see myself as a queen<br>
i was lost and look for a map ,<br>
a map that bring me a miracle<br>
and miraculous, <br>
you are, there.<br>
you are, somewhere i wanna go home.<br>
even without a flashlight,<br>
on a darkness hole ....<br>
a way to you, was beautiful.<br>
even on a largest tears of ocean,<br>
the sounds of you, was beautiful.<br>

no matter what,<br>
no matter hard.<br>
i will always be, i will always shine.<br>
and with all of the stuffs you gave me with all the loves,<br>
i give you a crown of my life.<br>

please be,<br>
forever, my king. my love. my everything.<br>
