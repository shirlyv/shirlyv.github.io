*The mark of your kiss is still attached to me,*<br>
*I feel it's still close,*<br>
*I still smell you clearly,*<br>
*But now your presence is uncertain;*<br>
*Where are you?*<br>
*I try to follow the shadow of our steps,*<br>
*But I still didn't find anything.*<br>
*I couldn't find the answer;*<br>
*You just disappeared.*<br>

*Where are you...*<br>
*I looked for you until I got lost,*<br>
*I loooked for you until I almost dying*<br>
*And i love you,*<br>
*And got lost, and crazy, and died.*<br>

*Where are you...*<br>
*For everything i have done,*<br>
*Tell me why you're still gone*<br>
*At the end,*<br>
*I got nothing.*<br>
