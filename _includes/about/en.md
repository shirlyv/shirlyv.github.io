Hello there!<br>
I am Shierly Vicky Mellinda Raihana, sometimes i can be Linda and on some speacial moments, i can be Hana.<br>
I learn how to writing well until someday i can proudly call myself as an author. I write poems and stories.<br>
However, i'm accidentally growing into a teacher.<br>


My current interests range from how to parenting to how to communicating each other fluently and effectively.
